## Google Fu

**To Search A Phrase:**

**To Exclude a Word in a Search:**
- Use a hypen (-something) to exclude it from the search results: 
- `pics of sunglasses -Pinterest`
- The above will return results for pictures of sunglasses but omit pinterest results.

**Site-Specific Searches:**
- To search a specific site for content use the following: 
- `joe biden site: nytimes.com`
- This will search the nytimes.com for any results with Joe Biden in it and only return nytimes.com results.

**Search for Sites that Link to A Target Site:**
- The following will find sites that link to the target site:

**Use Wildcards for Searches:**
- Sometimes when searching for song lyrics you don't know the exact words, wildcards can help.
- `"Excuse * while I kiss this *"`

**Search for Similar Sites:**
- If you want search for sites similar to say shopify, then you can do the following:

**Search for Multiple Keywords/Phrases at Once:**

- `chocolate OR dark chocolate`

**Search for Range of Numbers:**
- It's helpful to search for exact results with numbers, like who won the super bowl in 2009
- `super bowl ..2009`
- The example indicates you ONLY want the results for 2009 super bowl
- If you want a range of years, for example:
- `super bowl 2001..2009`
- This example will give the super bowl winners from 2001-2009
